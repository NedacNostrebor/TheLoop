## 1. Colors

Usage: Light, mid, and deep blues are associated with the serenity of a blue sky reflected over a calm sea; blue brings a feeling of respite and introspection - a quiet, cool permanence. The secondary colors are meant to be used sparingly as accent colors that bring some pop and energy to designs.
